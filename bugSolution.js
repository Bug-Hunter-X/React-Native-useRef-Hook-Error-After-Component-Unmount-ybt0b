The solution involves using the cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook to prevent these errors. The cleanup function runs before the component unmounts, ensuring that any asynchronous operations are stopped. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let intervalId;
    if (ref.current) {
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        console.log('Component is mounted:', ref.current);
      }, 1000);
    }
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View ref={ref}>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```

This revised code ensures that `setInterval` is only called if `ref.current` is available and that `clearInterval` is called when the component unmounts, preventing the error.
