This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native to access a component's instance after it has been unmounted.  This usually happens when asynchronous operations are still running after the component is unmounted, leading to attempts to access a null or undefined value.  For example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const ref = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      // This will throw an error if the component is unmounted before this line executes
      if(ref.current) {
        console.log('Component is mounted:', ref.current);
      }
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View ref={ref}>
      {/* ... */}
    </View>
  );
}
export default MyComponent;
```
